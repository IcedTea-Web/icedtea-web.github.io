<p>The project was formerly hosted as part of the <a href="https://icedtea.classpath.org">icedtea.classpath.org</a> project but moved to GitHub.</p>

<p>The 1.7 and 1.8 release branches of IcedTeaWeb have been migrated to GitHub for fixing bugs in the previews releases.
Next to this a new project structure has been established in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch.
Here the project is being migrated to Maven and more usage of Java 8 APIs are being introduced.
Based on this IcedTeaWeb can be transformed to a general WebStart / JNLP API that JDK and tool vendors can use to offer JNLP functionality.
A good example is <a href="https://openwebstart.com/">OpenWebStart</a> that will be based on IcedTeaWeb.</p>
